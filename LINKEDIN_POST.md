I built a tool that can help you land your dream tech job in 6 months.

Here's the truth nobody tells you about DSA prep:

It's not about solving 1000 random problems.
It's about solving the RIGHT 500 problems in the RIGHT order.

So I built the DSA 500 Tracker — a free, open-source web app that gives you:

A curated list of 491 LeetCode problems
16 core topics (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, DP, and more)
A structured 6-month study plan (69 sessions, week by week)
Cloud sync so your progress follows you everywhere
A dashboard that shows your streaks, stats, and weak areas

Here's the 6-month roadmap I follow:

Month 1-2: Arrays, Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window
Month 3: Stacks, Binary Search, Linked Lists
Month 4: Trees, Tries, Backtracking
Month 5: Heaps, Graphs, Dynamic Programming
Month 6: Greedy, Intervals, Advanced DP, Revision

Every problem is tagged with:
- Difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Pattern (Hash Map, BFS, Kadane's, etc.)
- Priority (Must Do / Good Practice / Revision)
- Key Insight

The tool tracks everything:
- Which problems you've solved
- Your daily streak
- Completion % per topic
- Personal notes on every problem

No excuses. No $300 courses. No premium subscriptions.

Just a free tracker, 500 problems, and 6 months of consistency.

Try it here: https://leetcode500.web.app
Source code: https://github.com/Aditya1156/Leetcode500

Built with vanilla JavaScript (no React, no frameworks), Firebase for cloud sync, and deployed on Firebase Hosting.

If this helps even one person crack their coding interview, it was worth building.

Drop a "500" in the comments if you're starting your DSA journey.

## Tips for posting:

1. **Add screenshots** — Attach 3-4 screenshots of the app (Problems page, Study Plan, Dashboard, Landing Page)
2. **Post timing** — Tuesday-Thursday between 8-10 AM IST or 8-10 AM EST gets the most reach
3. **First comment** — Drop the link in the first comment too (LinkedIn algorithm favors posts without links in the body, so optionally remove the URLs from the post and put them in comment #1)
4. **Engage** — Reply to every comment within the first 2 hours
5. **Tag people** — Tag 2-3 friends who are also prepping for interviews

## Alternative shorter version (for higher engagement):

I spent weeks building a free tool for DSA prep.

No premium. No paywall. No course to sell.

Just 500 curated LeetCode problems + a 6-month study plan.

What it does:
- 491 problems across 16 topics
- Week-by-week study roadmap
- Track solved problems, streaks, and notes
- Cloud sync across devices
- Dark mode (obviously)

Built with vanilla JS. No React. No frameworks.
